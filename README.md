# Sample Demo Scene for Regression Games

This is a sample demo scene for the [Regression Games Unity Bots SDK](https://docs.regression.gg/). It is an environment
that is used in our getting started tutorial to walk through the basics of our Unity integration, how to get a bot up
and running, and how to use the Agent Builder tool.

Please get started through our tutorial, located [here on our docs site.](https://docs.regression.gg/studios/unity/tutorials/first_tutorial)
